1. use custom errors and #[debug(Errors)]
2. each req gives you 400, so run a loop until the Date is current Date
3. use .configure for maintaining modular routes
4. write custom macros if used
5. write a cronjob to update the db for certain time with sending current time in params
6. pagination in fetching
7. same params as midgaurd
